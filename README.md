# Text-transmission-using-Laser--Li-fi-
In this project, text is being sent to one PC to another PC through laser. Due to its low noise ratio, it is one of the most well suited communication medium. We use Arduino to program laser to send binary bits to solar panel which then gives a character based on what binary numbers has been sent.
